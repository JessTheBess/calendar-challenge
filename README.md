# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

This challenge assignment was to make a functioning hour based task list, that kept track of tasks as well as time.
In the HTML I added the row items and gave them respective ID and classes to help identify them in the CSS and js.
In the CSS I changed the .description to fit the class name of .desc that I used and changed the task time colors of past, present and future.
In js I added the date and live time as well as the saving to local storage.
